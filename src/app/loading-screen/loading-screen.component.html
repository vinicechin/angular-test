      You can use the navigation bar above to check info about movies, characters, species, planets, vehicles or starships of the first seven episodes.

      You can also use the filter of each section to look for a specific item you'd like to know more about, so you don't need to keep scrolling to find your favorite character - which it's obviously C3PO.
